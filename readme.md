# Material Sience with Machine Learning

## Abstract

In this repo I collect and review recent process in the appilication of machine learning technologies in material science, especially in the field of density functional theory(DFT). I will keep update this repo until further notice. The `readme.md` is written in the format of a scientific paper which I think is of fun.
